1. 
These test scripts setup a file structure that remember-rotate.sh can 
operate on. Each test file structure is tailored to test a specific 
function of remember-rotate.sh  

2.
The unittest syntax check can be verified by executing check-unittest-syntax.sh.
Please monitor the output for syntax errors.

    remember-backup$ ./check-unittest-syntax.sh

3.
These tests are not meant to be run unattended, there is no analysis of the 
results implemented. See the proper usage of the unittests below. The analysis 
consists of observing the file structure changes before and after excution of 
remember-rotate.sh.
    
    remember-backup$ unittest/test-<of choice>.sh
    remember-backup$ ls -al unittest/test*
    remember-backup$ ./remember.rotate.sh
    remember-backup$ ls -al unittest/test*
